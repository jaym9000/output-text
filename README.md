# Write Text to File & Convert 16 bit to int
  These 2 C programs were assignments for class.\
  One of the files had us take input from user and write the text to a text file.\
  The other file had us take input from the user (only 16 bit input) and return the integer that correlates to it.
  
  **To run the program:**\
  There is a file called 'Makefile' which will take care of the compiling. 
  To activate this file you need to run the following in your terminal: 
  
  make -f Makefile \
  make all
  
  Now to run the c files just type './writeFile' for writeFile.c and './convertToHex' for convertToHex.c
